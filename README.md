## iOS Developer Home Assignment

**Objective:** The goal of this assignment is to evaluate your ability to create
a simple iOS application. This task is designed to showcase your coding
skills, understanding of iOS app development, and ability to implement
user-facing features.

### Project: Simple Shopping App

**Overview:** Develop a mobile application that functions as a
straightforward shopping platform, featuring a list of products and a
shopping basket. The core functionality includes adding or removing items
from the basket and performing currency conversions on the total amount.

**Product Catalog:** The application will offer a selection of goods (priced in
US dollars) for purchase:
- **Potato:** $0.95 per bag

- Add or remove items to/from the basket.
- View the total cost, 

**Checkout Feature:** Implement a checkout button that, when clicked,
displays the total price of items in the basket. Include the ability to show
this total in various currencies. For example, if the basket contains milk
and the selected currency is EUR with an exchange rate of 1.1, the total
should be displayed as 1.43 EUR.

**UI Design:** There are no specific UI design requirements. You have the
freedom to design the interface in a way you believe best suits the
application.

#### Technical Requirements:
The application must be written in Swift and RxSwift. Also in addition we
attached a json with example respons that will simulate data from service.

**Code Quality:** Pay close attention to memory management, performance,
code quality, testability, and maintainability. Your code

### Deliverables:
Submit a complete set of development artifacts, enabling the appâ€™s review
and execution in a simulator.
Commit your project to a GitHub repository. Provide a link to this
repository for review.
Ensure the project structure is clear and navigable, with self-explanatory
filenames and a concise readme detailing setup and operation
instructions.
